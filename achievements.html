                            conducted by CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education). Thankfully, I secured first rank
                            in my batch of 80 students at JNV Muzaffarpur and was placed among the top 50 students
                            across Bihar and Jharkhand. This was the second time when my father was happy with my
                            performance.

                            East Asia Network of Exchange for Students and Youths). Thus, we (a total of 72 Indian
                            students) had been to Japan for 10 days in December 2007. Thanks to the generous Japan
                            Government for sponsoring our trip and special thanks to the liberal Indian Government for
                            allowing us to be a part of this exchange program. This was the very first time,
